### Background Information:
- LoRaWAN protocol was first released in 2015
- Physical layer = coverage, interference, optimization
- LoRa is a RF modulation and corresponds to the physical layer in OSI reference model.
- LoRaWAN is a MAC layer standard which coordinates the medium.
- This type of modulation employs sinusoidal waveforms whose instantaneous frequency increases or decreases linearly over time.
- LoRa = Long range = wireless tech - low powered sender transmits small data packages (0.3 - 5.5 kbps) to a receiver over a long distance
- Gateway = handles 100â€™s of devices at the same time
- Lora end node -> radio module with antenna & a microprocessor to process sensor data - battery powered
- Lora device -> wireless transceiver -> acts as a remote sensor in case it has sensors
- Lora gateway -> radio module with antenna and a microprocessor to process data -> mains poweres and connected to Internet 
- LoRa = wireless modulation technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum(CSS) tech - encodes info on radio waves using chirp pulses
- Sweep rate and bandwidth change
- Preamble | Sync Message | Payload | CRC
- Data can be transmitted at longer ranges when compared to WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee
- LoRa -> owned by SemTech


### Comparison between LoRa and LTE
Property | LoRa | LTE
|---|---|---|
Modulation Technique | CSS | FDMA
Data Rate | 50 kbps | 10 Mbps
Link Budget | 154 dBM | 130 dBM

- LoRa alliance = used by companies
- LorA WAN = connects LoRa with 4G as an Internet - commercially or as a hobby
